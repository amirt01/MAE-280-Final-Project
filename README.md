# MAE-151-Final-Project
For this project, we are designing an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Our strategy is to use four motors in a + configuration with the front and back oriented vertically and the sides facing forwards. The motors will be mounted on a frame with a dry tube in the center for electronics.
